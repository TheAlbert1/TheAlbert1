# Hello :-)
I'm Albert, a student in Sweden intrigued by all things IT.

Learning about computer networks, deploying them, managing network equipment, and web development. There's always something fun to learn.

Feel free to look around my projects (they'll come with time), and reach out via an issue if you have any questions.

## Projects I like:
- [libjxl](https://github.com/libjxl/libjxl): reference implementation for the new and exciting JPEG XL image format
- [oxipng](https://github.com/shssoichiro/oxipng): a lossless PNG compressor I find myself using frequently
- [FLAC](https://github.com/xiph/flac): the lossless audio codec to use for ripped CDs
