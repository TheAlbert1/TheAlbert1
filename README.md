# Hello :-)
I'm Albert, a student in Sweden intrigued by all things IT.

Currently learning about computer networks, managing physical servers and server racks, web development, and deploying networks. There's always something to learn.

Feel free to look around my projects (they'll come with time!), and reach out via an issue if you have any questions.

## Projects I like:
- [libjxl](https://github.com/libjxl/libjxl): the reference implementation for the new and exciting JPEG XL image format
- [oxipng](https://github.com/shssoichiro/oxipng): a good lossless PNG compressor that I find myself using frequently
- [FLAC](https://github.com/xiph/flac): who doesn't like a free lossless audio codec?
