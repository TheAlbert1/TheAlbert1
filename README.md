# Hello :-)
I'm Albert, a student in Sweden intrigued by all things IT. There's always something fun to learn.

Feel free to look around my projects (they'll come with time), and reach out via an issue if you have any questions.

## Projects I like:
- [libjxl](https://github.com/libjxl/libjxl): reference implementation for the new and exciting JPEG XL image format
- [oxipng](https://github.com/shssoichiro/oxipng): a nice lossless PNG compressor. Also the only time where pronouncing PNG as "Ping" sounds better
- [FLAC](https://github.com/xiph/flac): the lossless audio codec to use for ripping CDs
