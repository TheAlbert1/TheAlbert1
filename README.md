I'm Albert, a student intrigued by all things IT. There's always something fun to learn.

## Software I like
- [libjxl](https://github.com/libjxl/libjxl), the reference implementation for the JPEG XL image format.
- [oxipng](https://github.com/shssoichiro/oxipng), a lossless PNG compressor.
- [FLAC](https://github.com/xiph/flac), a lossless compressed audio codec.
