# Hello :-)
I'm Albert, a student in Sweden intrigued by all things IT. There's always something fun to learn.

## Projects I like
- [libjxl](https://github.com/libjxl/libjxl): reference implementation for the new and exciting JPEG XL image format
- [oxipng](https://github.com/shssoichiro/oxipng): a nice lossless PNG compressor. Also the only time where pronouncing PNG as "Ping" sounds better
- [FLAC](https://github.com/xiph/flac): the lossless audio codec to use for ripping CDs
