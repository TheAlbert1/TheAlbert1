# Hello :-)
I'm Albert, a student in Sweden intrigued by all things IT. Currently learning about computer networks, configuring servers, and troubleshooting them. Also learning about basic web development where I make a simple, static website from scratch. I value good cable management, and believe there's always something to learn.

## Projects I like:

- [libjxl](https://github.com/libjxl/libjxl): the reference implementation for the new and exciting JPEG XL image format
- [oxipng](https://github.com/shssoichiro/oxipng): a good lossless PNG compressor that I find myself using frequently
- [FLAC](https://github.com/xiph/flac): who doesn't like a free lossless audio codec?

## Things I'm good at:
- Writing HTML and CSS by hand
- Always being on time
- Being comfortable with terminals/CLIs

## That's it!
Feel free to look around my nonexistent projects (they'll come with time!), and reach out via an issue if you have any questions.
